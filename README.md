# lutho-os

**This image is considered pre-alpha** 

This image is a fork of [Bluefin](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin), but based on Fedora Kinoite instead of Fedora Silverblue, and customized for my ([@ethanjli](https://github.com/ethanjli)'s) own personal requirements.

*Lutho* is the name of my Framework 13 AMD laptop which this *lutho-os* image is being maintained for. The name comes from a character in Ken Liu's silkpunk novel series *The Dandelion Dynasty*:

> Lutho: patron of Haan; god of fishermen, divination, mathematics, and knowledge; his pawi is the sea turtle.

## Usage

I do not recommend using this image unless you are me (@ethanjli) - I occasionally experiment with changes in pull requests where I build and push the changes to the images for testing on my laptop before I merge the pull requests into the main branch, which means that some images will occasionally be broken. However, please feel free to study [the changes I've made from Bluefin](https://github.com/ethanjli/lutho-os/compare/bluefin-main...ethanjli:lutho-os:main) as a reference for how you might make your own Kinoite-based fork of Bluefin.

I use the `ghcr.io/ethanjli/lutho-dx:39` image, e.g. with the following `rpm-ostree` commands:

```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ethanjli/lutho-dx:39
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ethanjli/lutho-dx:39
```

## Scope

For now I will try to stay generally close to the Bluefin upstream, but I'll also experiment with new features and try to resolve things which might be annoyances specifically to me (e.g. I don't need or want Solaar, which is included in Bluefin).

I will try to do other customizations (e.g. KDE Plasma configurations, homefiles, declarative configurations in userland, custom distrobox images) in other repositories as much as possible. The goal is to eventually get all configurations managed on GitHub and all data synchronized with online storage (and/or with other devices via SyncThing) in a way that makes it relatively easy for me to wipe my computer and restore everything.
